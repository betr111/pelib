Version 1.? -
    *   Now precompiled headers are used in a correct way.

    *   Made some functions constant/static.

    *   Added the resource directory entry information to the
        CResourceDirectory class.

    *   Renamed samples.doc to samples.txt for consistency.

    *   Made PortableExecutable.h a bit more readable.

Version 1.2 -
    *   Added a new data directory class, CDD_Resource.

    *   Changed CUtil's interface, now we use it in a better way.

    *   Fixed a bug in the CSection class.

    *   Added a check for non-standard MZ headers.

    *   Fixed SetStub sample when using a stub from a PE file.

    *   Removed tabs from sources, I hate tabs!

    *   Changed lists so they contain pointers, now CDD_Debug::SetTable
        works fine.

    *   Now the CPortableExecutable::Load method will also fix PE
        section offsets, section sizes, image size, header size.

    *   Added a new data directory class, CDD_Copyright.

    *   Alot of code adjustments.

    *   CSectionImport/Export needn't be inherited from CSection.

Version 1.1 -
    *   Moved section list definitions to section header file.

    *   Removed NUM_DEB_TYPES from CDD_Debug header and placed a
        constant value in CUtil class that says how many debug types.
        Also added GetNumDebugTypes() method to CUtil.

    *   Moved class-used definitions into the classes they belong
        to.

    *   PEAC sample fixed (build settings were on PE lib, so it wasn't
        fixed in previous release).

    *   Major CSectionImport bug fixed, interface has also changed.

    *   Fixed AddSection() to work on (non-standard) PEs that have
        VirtualSize = 0 (or lower than SizeOfRawData), this affects
        CSectionImport and CSectionExport, also resulted in adding
        a method to CPortableExecutable: FixSectionSizes().

    *   Minor code adjustments

    *   Added new method to CPortableExecutable: SetNewStub(), can
        set new DOS stub for the PE. A sample for it can be found
        (SetStub).

    *   Fixed FixSectionOffsets().

    *   Added GetNumSections() method.

    *   Removed semi-support for (very) old compilers. This library
        is designed to work on MSVC6/7.

Version 1.0 fixed
    *   Fixed samples.

Version 1.0 - Initial release.
